Divide the number of students enrolled who are of the official age group for primary education by the population for the same age group and multiply the result by 100. NER at each level of education should be based on enrolment of the relevant age group in all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes. A high NER denotes a high degree of coverage for the official school-age population. The theoretical maximum value is 100%. Increasing trends can be considered as reflecting improving coverage at the specified level of education. When the NER is compared with the GER, the difference between the two highlights the incidence of under-aged and over-aged enrolment. If the NER is below 100%, then the complement, i.e. the difference with 100%, provides a measure of the proportion of children not enrolled at the specified level of education. However, since some of these children\/youth could be enrolled at other levels of education, this difference should in no way be considered as indicating the percentage of students not enrolled. To measure universal primary education, for example, adjusted primary NER is calculated on the basis of the percentage of children in the official primary school age range who are enrolled in either primary or secondary education. A more precise complementary indicator is the Age-specific enrolment ratio (ASER) which shows the participation in education of the population of each particular age, regardless of the level of education.","sourceOrganization":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","topics":[{"id":"4","value":"Education "}]},{"id":"SE.PRM.HIAT.MA.ZS","name":"Educational attainment, completed primary, population 25+ years, male (%)","source":{"id":"14","value":"Gender Statistics"},"sourceNote":"The percentage of population ages 25 and over that attained or completed primary education as the highest level of education.","sourceOrganization":"United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics.","topics":[{"id":"17","value":"Gender"}]},{"id":"SE.PRM.HIAT.FE.ZS","name":"Educational attainment, completed primary, population 25+ years, female (%)","source":{"id":"14","value":"Gender Statistics"},"sourceNote":"The percentage of population ages 25 and over that attained or completed primary education as the highest level of education.","sourceOrganization":"United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics.","topics":[{"id":"17","value":"Gender"}]},{"id":"SE.PRM.GINT.ZS","name":"Gross intake ratio to Grade 1 of primary education, both sexes (%)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Total number of new entrants in the first grade of primary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population at the official primary school-entrance age.
