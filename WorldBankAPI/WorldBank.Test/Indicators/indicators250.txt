A relatively high SLE indicates greater probability for children to spend more years in education and higher overall retention within the education system. It must be noted that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed, because of repetition. Since school life expectancy is an average based on participation in different levels of education, the expected number of years of schooling may be pulled down by the magnitude of children who never go to school.

NERA should be based on total enrolment of the official primary school participation age group in primary and secondary education for all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes (pre-primary education must be excluded). NERA gives more precise measure of the participation of the official primary school age population to the education system (excluding pre-primary education). It reflects the actual level of achievement of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) goal. In fact, while the Net enrolment rate (NER) shows the coverage of pupils in the official primary school age group in the primary education level only, the NERA extends the measure to those of the official primary school age range who have reached secondary education because they might access primary education earlier than the official entrance or they might skip some grades due to their performance. Increasing NERA might mirror improving participation of children in the official primary school age, the decrease of the target population or both. A value of 100% indicates theoretically that the country has accomplished the UPE goal. However, this condition is not sufficient for UPE due to, for example, a high repetition rate, which might lead pupils to dropout after primary school age without completing primary education. The difference between NERA and NER provides a measure of the proportion of children in the official primary age group who are enrolled in secondary education.","sourceOrganization":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","topics":[{"id":"4","value":"Education "}]},{"id":"SE.PRM.TCHR.FE.ZS","name":"Primary education, teachers (% female)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Female teachers as a percentage of total primary education teachers includes full-time and part-time teachers.","sourceOrganization":"United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics.","topics":[{"id":"4","value":"Education "},{"id":"17","value":"Gender"}]},{"id":"SE.PRM.TCHR.FE","name":"Teachers in primary education, female (number)","source":{"id":"12","value":"Education Statistics"},"sourceNote":"Total number of female teachers in public and private primary education institutions.
