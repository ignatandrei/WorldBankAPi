Data was collected in 2011 by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) from Ministries of Education and development partners on selected Paris Declaration indicators, which were adapted for the education sector, and on other additional information. Three tools were used to collect this data: the Ministry of Education Questionnaire and the Donor questionnaire for quantitative data, and an Explanatory Note for qualitative data. The GPE Secretariat worked closely with Local Education Groups (LEGs ) to collect, process, produce, review and validate this information; and the Coordinating Agency or lead donor was tasked to coordinate the exercise with the LEG and to work with the Ministry of Education.
