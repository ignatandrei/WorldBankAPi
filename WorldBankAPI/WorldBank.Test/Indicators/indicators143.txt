Students at Level 3 have reached the Sufficient Competency Threshold. They are able to answer arithmetic and measurement questions that require them to analyze situations and decide on the appropriate approach. In arithmetic, they can solve problems involving fractions or decimal numbers, and in measurement, they can solve problems involving surface area or perimeter calculations. Pupils can find data on a diagram prior to calculating distances. They are also able to perform calculations and conversions involving hours, minutes and seconds.

Students at Level 2 have reached the Sufficient Competency Threshold, and are able to answer brief arithmetic, measurement and geometry questions by resorting to the three assessed processes: knowing, applying and reasoning. Some questions call on factual knowledge or a scientific approach; others require analysis of a situation prior to determining the appropriate approach. In arithmetic, students can perform operations with decimal numbers and can also solve familiar problems by analyzing the wording of the question or extracting data from a double-entry table. They know how to complete logical series with decimal numbers or fractions. In measurement, pupils can tell the time and convert units of measurement with or without a conversion table. They are also able to solve arithmetic problems involving operations with units of length or days, hours and minutes. In geometry, pupils know the names of certain solids, basic geometric shapes and some characteristic lines (diagonal, median). Data were published for this indicator beginning with PASEC 2014.

In arithmetic, they are able to carry out the four basic operations with whole numbers. In measurement, they recognize the length measurement unit: the meter. In geometry, they are able to orientate themselves in space by identifying directions and positions and by reading coordinates on a graph.
